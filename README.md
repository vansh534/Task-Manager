# Project To-Do List

Welcome to the To-Do List project! This project allows you to manage your tasks efficiently with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The data is stored locally, and you can sort tasks based on type, priority, and due date.

## Features

1. **Create:** Add new tasks to your to-do list with ease. Specify the task type, set its priority, and define a due date.

2. **Read:** View your entire to-do list at a glance. Tasks are displayed in a clear and organized manner.

3. **Update:** Edit existing tasks to reflect changes. You can modify task details, such as type, priority, and due date.

4. **Delete:** Remove completed or unnecessary tasks from your list. Keep your to-do list clutter-free.

5. **Sorting:**
   - **By Type:** Sort tasks based on their type for better categorization.
   - **By Priority:** Arrange tasks by priority level to focus on the most important ones first.
   - **By Due Date:** Order tasks by their due dates to stay on top of deadlines.
